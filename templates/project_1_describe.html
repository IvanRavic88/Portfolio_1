                launch of the site, the client has the opportunity to add and
                delete cakes that are on offer on its own.

                GaginiSlatkisi. The final product required the creation of a

                application, as well as deployment on a VPS.

                >The client requested me to develop the application from
                scratch. I worked with them to detemine the core features and
                presented a plan.
                <p>
                  Using <strong>Figma</strong>, I created an initial design that
                  I adjusted as necessary in a conversation with the client.
                  After the client's confirmation that the design is excellent,
                  I started developing the front-end part using
                  <strong>CSS</strong> and <strong>HTML</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Flask</strong> was used for the server side, and
                  <strong>Jinja</strong>
                  for dynamic page display.
                  <strong>FlaskForm</strong> was used for the email and login
                  form. For the client login was used
                  <strong>flask_login</strong> and for the database
                  <strong>SQLAlchemy</strong>. <strong>PIL</strong> was used to
                  resize the image that is uploaded by the client, so that the
                  cards of each candy have the same dimensions.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After finishing and testing the server part of the
                  application, it was time to bring the application online. For
                  this purpose, a virtual environment was created on
                  <strong>EC2 (AWS)</strong>, using <strong>Ubuntu</strong>,
                  <strong>Bash</strong>, <strong>Gunikorn</strong> and
                  <strong>NGNX</strong>, on which the website is currently
                  running.

                >The main goal of the project was to make it scalable and
                flexible enough so that it would support future updates. In
                order to achieve this, a database was necessary. But the use of
                that database had to be adapted to the client, and for that
                purpose a form of the appropriate shape was used, which is
                visible only to the logged in user.
                <p>
                  In this way, it was achieved that the application can be
                  updated with minimal effort from the client.
