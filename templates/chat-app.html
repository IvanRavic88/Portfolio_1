                  <strong>Figma</strong> was used for the design part. The

                  After finishing and testing the front-end and back-end of the

                  Vercel was used for this purpose, as the best solution.

                adaptable.
                <p>
                  The biggest problem during the development of the application
                  was caused by an error during import the MUI library. The
                  entire library was imported, instead of the required element.
                  In this way, the compilation itself took too long and the
                  operation of the application was significantly slowed down.
                  After debugging, the error was corrected and the speed of the
                  application returned to normal.
