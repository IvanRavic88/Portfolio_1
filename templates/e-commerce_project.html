                Vercel.

                Sanity was used. In this way, great flexibility of the site and
                easy use as well as update was achieved.
                <p>
                  <strong>Figma</strong> was used for the design part. The
                  modern look is achieved by combining standard
                  <strong>CSS</strong> and <strong>Material UI</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>NextJS</strong> was used for the server side, while
                  <strong>ReactJS</strong> is used for the front-end. Since this
                  project was conceived as a ready-to-use website,
                  <strong>Stripe</strong> was used for the product payment in
                  test mode.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After finishing and testing the front-end and back-end of the
                  application, it was time to bring the application online.
                  Vercel was used for this purpose, as the best solution.

                  Application made in this way enables easy adaptation to a wide
